The programm is designed to run on a linux machine using the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) 
for audio handling.

Libraries:
To run the programm you need to install the following three libraries:
    - libasound2-dev
    - fftw
    - portaudio



1. libasound2-dev:
    Is required for software that makes use of the ALSA library.

    It can be downloaded as a package for example from APT.
    APT command: sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev



2. fftw:
    Needed to perform the discrete Fourier transform which is needed for the filters.

    It can be downloaded on their website (https://www.fftw.org/download.html). The recommended version 
    is 3.3.10 since fftw-3.3.10 was used during development.
    Follow the steps on their website to get the library up and running 
    (https://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html).



3. portaudio
    Is a library that automatically handles the ALSA device setup for the program.

    It can be downloaded on their website (https://files.portaudio.com/download.html). The recommended
    version is v190700_20210406 since it was used during development.
    Setup the library using their documentation 
    (https://files.portaudio.com/docs/v19-doxydocs/compile_linux.html).

    The portaudio folder is needed for compiling the voice changer so don't forget where you 
    saved it.


GUI:
Qt was used for the GUI (version: Qt 6.7.2).

1. Download Qt
    You need to install the open source variant (https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) and start the setup process.
    (chmod +x <filename>.run makes the downloaded run file executable)

2. Create Qt account

3. Downloaded recommended librarys

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev
    source: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux.html

    sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype-dev libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxrender-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-glx0-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-sync-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev
    source: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux-requirements.html

4. Open the Project
    Qt Kit used during development: Qt 6.7.2, gcc-12 and g++-12
    Open Qt Creator and choose "open project" on the welcome page. Navigate to the project folder and select the VoiceChanger.pro file.
    Then you need to choose a kit which contains the Qt version and compilers used by Qt.
    The header, source and form files should be seperated into their own folders in the project view on the left of the Qt Creator.
    The last step is to include portaudio as an external library. For that right click on the VoiceChanger folder in the hierarchy on the left.
    Select "add library" and choose external library. You can find the library file in the portaudio directory that you installed previously under
    <path to lib folder>/portaudio/lib/.libs/libportaudio.a and the include path is <path to lib folder>portaudio/include.



Compiling:
After setting up the project you need to compile it using the Qt Creator GUI (bottom left) and also start it there.
After that you can always start and compile the application via the terminal. You can find the application in you project folder
under build/Desktop_Qt_6_7_2-Debug.
Terminal commands:  make            //to compile
                    make clean
                    ./VoiceChanger  //to start the application


If the audio stream doesn't start and you get an underrun error then you need to increase the buffer size from 512 to 2024.
You can find the buffer size in Constants.h under the name FRAMES_PER_BUFFER.
