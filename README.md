# MUME-project
The project was developed to run on a raspberry pi 4. It can also run on any linux distribution which uses ALSA.

## Overview
The project consists of three simple audio filters (pitch shift, echo, robot) which manipulate the audio stream in realtime. It also includes a simple GUI where the filters can be activated.

## Installation
The setup file explaines each step to run the application in great detail.
